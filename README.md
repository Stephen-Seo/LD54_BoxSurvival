## About This Game

This entry was my first foray into making something with Godot. It definitely
is a step up (several steps up) from writing games from scratch (which I used
to do with previous ldjam entries, using libraries like Raylib). What I mean to
say, is that this game was more of an experiment to test Godot and it has
passed my test. I will not be voting other games (but probably will comment on
them) since I am somewhat time restricted (currently taking a course) since I
don’t think I was serious enough when making this game, so I don’t think it
should get a rating. In the future, I definitely will be using Godot though,
and hopefully with a game with more content.

EDIT: Just realized that ldjam.com allows you to opt out of ratings, so I'll do
that.
